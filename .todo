design
------

. use props and map to generate list of polls on the page. 
. use state to keep counter values on different selections.
. will need to figure out how to store/retrieve polling types and relevant data. seems like a lot of data to keep in state at once...? or maybe not.
. should rewrite to make the entire page a grid setup rather than only the header and pollbox. 

functions
---------

. convert notes to markdown
. get header to blink based on width. not sure if done through react or scss. 

. figure out a mapping of hex color schemes that is replicatable. 
. function that translates system state (like screen width/height, variables? props? state?)
into colorscheme. 



poll api
--------

find user poll api with 2-4 selections. 
create functions to pull data and insert into application.

Need to get new twitter account and apply for API access.

Twitter polls will provide awesome starting point for data to use and adjust for my different poll types.
