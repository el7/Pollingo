design
------

. should rewrite to make the entire page a grid setup rather than only the header and pollbox. 


functions
---------

. get header to blink based on width. not sure if done through react or scss. 

. figure out a mapping of hex color schemes that is replicatable. 
. function that translates system state (like screen width/height, variables? props? state?)
into colorscheme.
